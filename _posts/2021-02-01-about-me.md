# About Me

Hi, my name is Jaelin and I’m a Junior at CNU. My preferred pronouns are she/her. I’m not minoring in DH, but this course does count towards my major as an elective. After reading the course description I decided to enroll because it didn’t sound like anything that I had taken before and I was interested to see what the course involved. I am always looking for things to advance my writing, and while I am a little unsure as to how this class will help it, I am excited to find out.

I am not currently involved in any clubs but I do spend a great deal of my free time writing. When I’m not away at school I work at a dental office, but I have absolutely no interest in that field of work. After lots of switching back and forth I decided to  major in English and minor in Film studies. I hope to move to New York and  either be a screenwriter or a film critic someday. I am aware that moving to New York right after college is a little far fetched so I’ll probably take some time off after graduating so that I can get myself together a bit. 

I’m from Woodbridge in Northern Virginia, and while I do not currently have any pets, I am getting a pet bunny (_hopefully a Netherland Dwarf_) in the summer and am very excited at the idea of picking out names for him. I am an avid Harry Styles,Game of Thrones (_season 8 does not count in my mind_) ,Friends, and Stranger Things fan in that order. I spend most of my time on Tumblr [Visit Tumblr!](www.Tumblr.com) My favourite book is always changing, but at the moment it’s Howl's Moving Castle, and my favorite movie is The Social Network.
